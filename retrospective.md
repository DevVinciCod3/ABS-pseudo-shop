- Student 3: Harold Bryan Santos

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
_(Who worked on which features? How was the work assigned or negotiated?)_

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
_(E.g., branching, rebasing, frequent commits, etc.)_
We found git status and git branch helped us the most. For git status, we tend to forget what stage we're currrently in and it gave us an update and status of our files whether if we added, commit, or pushed it. For git branch, we found it also helpful since we're switching branches to check the progress of each other. This helps us be more mindful on which branch we are working on.

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
_(Include any lessons learned or techniques used to resolve the issue.)_
The merge conflict that we encountered was the overlapping of lines or we modified the same line. We also had done the same function for the product listing. We resolved the merge conflict through discussion on which to keep and modified the project on which function to go first based on the logic of the project.

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
_(This can include communication, Git usage, or coordination.)_
The biggest challenges during this activity were coordination and communication. Since it was our first time working with version control and collaborating through branches, we often struggled to figure out who should go first and what the next step should be. This lack of clear coordination made it difficult to move forward smoothly. We realized the importance of planning and clearly assigning tasks before starting the development process.

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
_(Any insights or habits youâ€™d apply in future projects?)_
Working with Git in a team setting taught us the importance of collaboration, communication, and proper workflow management. We learned how critical it is to coordinate tasks, use branches effectively, and follow a consistent commit and merge process to avoid conflicts. It also showed us how Git helps track changes, separate features, and combine work efficiently  but only if the team stays organized and communicates clearly.

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
_(Think about technical habits and teamwork practices.)_

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
_(What worked well? What was confusing or could be improved?)_
